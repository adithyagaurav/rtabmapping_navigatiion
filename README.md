# Real Time Appearance Based Mapping 

This repository implements the results of study on 3D mapping techniques for localization and navigation for 4 wheel differential
drive Robot.  Used Vision based rtabmap_ros package in ROS Kinetic to create 3D octomap and 2D occupancy grid of a gazebo environment. 

Went a step ahead and set up the navigation stack for the 4 Wheel robot to navigate in this 3D octomap and improved the local planning by integrating TEB Local Planner ROS package for obstacle avoidance
